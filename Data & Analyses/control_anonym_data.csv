        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else.

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else.

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else.

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

        <p>
            There are six parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        <p>Your choice is real, the other participant is real, and the amounts earned are real. The outcome of the choices will be final. You cannot communicate with the other participant, you will not be able to participate in the study again, and you will not be paired with the other participant for another choice after this choice.</p>
