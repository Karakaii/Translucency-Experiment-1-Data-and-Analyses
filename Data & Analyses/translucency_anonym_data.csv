        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <strong>If the other participant chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that their choice will be revealed to you.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black.

If the other participant’s choice is revealed, their choice will be you shown to you and you will be given the option to change your choice or to keep your initial choice.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:

                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black.

If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again.

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else.

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>

        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else.

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else.

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:

                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>

        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>

            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose A, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>If you chose B, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Your choice is real, the other participant is real, and the amounts earned are real. The outcome of the choices will be final. You cannot communicate with the other participant and you will not be able to participate in the study again.</p>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 20% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 2 are red and 8 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.

        <p>Welcome to this study and thank you for participation. You have been paired with another anonymous participant. You will be given a choice to make in order to win some money. The amount of money earned depends on the choice made by you and the choice made by the other participant. On top of the money earned according to the choices, you will each receive £1.00 for answering questions about yourself and your experience making the choices. Note that payment is conditional on you completing the study.</p>

            Please ensure that you set this page to fullscreen (press F11 on PC or go to &quot;view&gt;enter full screen&quot; on Mac).<br><br>
            Please ensure there are no distractions. <strong>This is a multiplayer game happening in real time, thereby, it is best for you and the other participant that you keep at the task at hand and do not do anything else. Notably, this will ensure you do not have to wait too long for the other participant to make their decision. </strong> <br><br>
            Please ensure the sound is working on your computer. Bell sounds will occur to signal that a certain phase of the study has started. <br><br>

            There are seven parts in this study:
            <ol>
                <li>Instructions</li>
                <li>Comprehension questions about the instructions that you must answer correctly in order to progress. If you answer them incorrectly, you will be presented with the questions again. You can click the <i>Show Instructions</i> button on the top right of the screen to show the instructions again.</li>
                <li>Making your choice.</li>
                <li>Answering a first series of questions.</li>
                <li>Potential detection and new choice.</li>
                <li>The outcome of the choices is revealed.</li>
                <li>Answering a second series of questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
            <p>
                You (and the other participant) can make one of two choices: <b>A or B</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose A</b>, you will earn £0.20 and the other participant will earn £0.20 as well.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose A and the other participant chooses B</b>, you will earn £0.70 and the other participant will earn £0.10.</li>
                    <li>If <b>you choose B and the other participant chooses A</b>, you will earn £0.10 and the other participant will earn £0.70.</li>
                    <li>If you <b>both choose B</b>, you will earn £0.50 and the other participant will earn £0.50 as well.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Here is a table summarising the choices and outcomes:</p>

        Once both you and the other participant have made your choices (but not before) the following procedure takes place:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Whichever choice you made, there is a 80% chance (randomly decided by the computer) that your choice will be revealed to the other participant.</strong> Imagine the computer having a jar of 10 marbles where 8 are red and 2 are black. The computer randomly draws one: if it is red, your choice will be revealed to the other participant; if it is black, your choice will not be revealed to the other participant. If your choice is revealed, the other participant will see your choice and they will be given the option to change their choice or to keep their initial choice. You will not be told if your choice was revealed or not to the other participant.
